## Newest Rule Changes

### SAR Version 1.14.1 has been released! (April 18th, 2025)

SAR Version 1.14.1 just dropped, adding a cheat command to allow experimenting with floor reportals, as well as a few fixes. This version of SAR has been released for a week, as such this is the version you are required to run on, otherwise runs will be rejected.

### The vm_debug has been banned and sar_hud_precision has been restricted for CM & SRC (March 19th,2025)

vm_debug is no longer an allowed console command. This was our justification for allowing decimal precision from 3-6 decimals, which are no longer allowed. As such, sar_hud_precision can only be at a value of 2 or less.
